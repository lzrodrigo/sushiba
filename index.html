        <h3>Sushiba's Next Generation Marketplace</h3>
        <h5>The Issue with Most Decentralized Marketplaces</h5>
        <p>They usually only cater to one demographic, i.e. creatives, which makes it hard for businesses, small, medium and large, to enter into the NFT space without being eclipsed by the hundreds of thousands other creative-focused NFTs.</p>
        <h5>Sushiba's Integration Solution</h5>
        <p>Sushiba's marketplace will accomodate all current and future use-cases of the Internet of Assets, as well as all its market participants.
            <br> The key is integration and easy accessibility to IoAs customized for the need of all purposes. This means that the NFT space will no longer be exclusive to creatives, but will also have dedicated spaces to businesses who want to level-up their asset digitalization.</p>
        <h5>A Store Built Just For You</h5>
        <p>Create your own store on the Sushiba Marketplace tailor-made to your own business needs.<br>We will offer complete customization options for businesses that seek to build their own stores within our NFT/IoA Marketplace.</p>
